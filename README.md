# Cryptographic Program
Java Implementation of symmetric & asymmetric cryptographic program such as encryption, decryption, signature verification, hash.

## Tasks
* AES encryption/decryption with two key lengths, 128 and 256 bits, and two modes ECB and CBC
* RSA encryption and decryption
* RSA Signature
* SHA-256 hashing

### Prerequisites
You need to install these softwares to run the project.
* Java 8 version or latest
* Any smart ide like Intellij IDEA, Eclipse or Android Studio 

### How to run
* First of all change the path from `Main.java` where you want to save the keys and signature otherwise you will get exception.
* Only run `Main.java` and give the inputs. Thus all the tasks will be executed.
* You can comment/uncomment specific tasks to run specific task in `Main.java`.
* Check Execution time of each algorithm in console after running. (Values in microsecond)
